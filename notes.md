## Subquery

A subquery can be ran independently from the outer query.

This is different when using a correlated subquery.

### Functional Dependencies

A functional dependency is a relationship between two attributes in a relation such that, for each value of the first attribute, there is exactly one value of the second attribute.

Example:

```
R(A, B, C)
A -> B
```
